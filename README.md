### Hello! I'm Hasan. Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate software developer with interests in fullstack development, machine learning and financial technology. Currently, I am a sophomore student studying Computer Science and Business at UBC.

A few projects I have worked on in the past include an [arbitrage detector in the forex market ](https://github.com/haltaf19/Arbitrage-Detector) and a [carpool routing application](https://github.com/haltaf19/groUber). You can learn more about my projects on my website: [https://www.hasanaltaf.xyz](https://www.hasanaltaf.xyz).

I'm looking for internships for Winter (Jan-Apr) and Summer (May-Aug) 2021. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasanaltaf/) or via e-mail.

Thank you for stopping by!
